<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Open Source Eats

The idea for Open Source Eats came from a conversation about how there's too much mystery behind some of our favorite foods. Copycat recipes vary in quality, and it's only after hours of labor that you come to learn the one you chose doesn't even come close to the original. By making the recipes, sourcing and processes behind our foods open source, anyone can recreate them. It also allows for contributions to our product lines, allowing us to constantly improve quality by leveraging the shared experiences of our community.


Here's some examples:
* A certain product may not be able to be shipped to your location. By following the available recipe, you can recreate it yourself at home.
* An ingredient in your favorite recipe isn't readily available where you live. By using our ingrediant alternatives database, you can find suitable options to substitute.
* You know of a better ingredient/source/process to use in the creation of a product. By submitting a pull request to update the recipe, your improvement becomes the standard for that product once approved.

While results can obviously vary by technique, equipment and quality of ingredients, we hope that by making our recipes readily available can allow anyone to enjoy what we make, whether we actaully make it or not.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The best way we've found to get started is to simply browse the recipes for anything that might catch your eye. Our website allows for advanced searches so if scanning the files here is too tedious, feel free to browse <a href="https://www.OpenSourceEats.com" target="_blank">https://www.OpenSourceEats.com</a>

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make our products, processes or tools better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with one of the <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceEats/OpenSourceEats/labels" target="_blank">labels</a> we have available.

Not every pull request needs to be a recipe. We're open to suggestions about every facet of our organization including recipes, web development/design, artwork, distribution, marketing and documentation. 

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Pull requests will be evaluated by senior memebers of our community once submitted. Please know that not all requests can be approved and not all recipes can be sold in our store. Some ideas, while great, may not be able to be easily recreated, distributed or made cost-effective. That doesn't mean a great recipe that uses prohibitively expensive equipment or hard to source ingredients without alternatives won't be included in our database though.

We will also do our best to give adequete feedback and explanations as to why something was not approved. Sometimes a small tweak may be all that's needed to get the request approved, so we will keep an open dialog going when needed.

Some general suggestions for getting your pull request approved:

* Provide a brief explanation for your changes. If a 
* Try to use widely available equipment and ingredients as much as possible.
* The more detail that is supplied about the process and sourcing, the better.
* Do not submit recipes that are not your own or that you do not have permission to share.
* While the expectation is not that every contributor be a professional chef, please do your best to follow industry standards for food preparation and safety.
* High quality photos of not only the final product, but entire process are strongly encouraged.
* Ingredient and equipment alternative requests must result in a comparable end result as the original. Using cauliflower crust on a pizza recipe that normally calls for a flour based crust would qualify as a new recipe. Using AP flour instead of bread flour would be considered a substitution.
* When in doubt, always reach out to a senior member of the community. We want as many ideas as possible to succeed, so we'll be happy to answer any questions or provide direction when desired.
